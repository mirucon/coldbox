## Getting Started
If you switch from other theme to this theme, we recommend you to regenerate all of your thumbnails with the Regenerate Thumbnails plugin. It will create consistent sizes of your thumbnails, with the appropriate size for this theme.

If you start your WordPress life with this theme, then there's no need to regenerate thumbnails. The theme will automatically create the appropriate size of your thumbnail every time you set a new thumbnail image.

Then, go ahead to the Theme Customizer to customize the theme as you like. Sections whose name started with "Coldbox:" are the settings we have added for you to customize. Don't forget, there's also a section called Colors so you can customize some colors used in the theme.

See "About Coldbox" page after installing the theme :)

To get a bootstrap of child theme, visit the [Coldbox official site](https://coldbox.miruc.co/).
